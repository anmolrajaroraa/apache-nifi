1. Decompress and untar
	bin directory -> ./nifi.sh <command>
-start -> start NiFi in the background
-stop -> stop NiFi that's running in background
-status -> provides you current status of nifi
-run -> run NiFi in the cmd directly
-service -> install NiFi as a service
	service nifi start
	service nifi stop
	service nifi status

1. Decompress
	bin directory -> double-click run-nifi.bat

These directories are created :-
1. content_repository
2. database_repository
3. flowfile_repository
4. provenance_repository
5. work directory
6. logs directory

Go to browser -> localhost:8080/nifi

Apache NiFi was built to manage data flow
-systems fail
-data access exceeds capacity to consume
-noise today can become resource tomorrow
-boundary conditions
-compliance and security
-continuous improvement occurs in production

Core components:-
1. FlowFile (information packet)
2. FlowFile Processor
3. FlowFile Controller (Scheduler)
4. Process Group

Before zero-master clustering

Zero-master clustering

Cluster is a group of nodes performing same tasks but on different data sets.

Why cluster?
1. To group all the nodes to increase processing capability
2. Clustering allows NiFi Administrators or DFM(DataFlow Managers) to have a single interface through which they can make dataflow changes and monitor the dataflow and status of all the nodes

Node - Nodes do the actual processing. Node is just a machine comprising of 3 simple resources - CPU power, RAM, disk space

ZooKeeper - electing Primary Node, electing Cluster Coordinator and acting as a middleware between different nodes so that they can communicate to each other

Cluster Coordinator - managing the nodes, providing up-to-date flow to newly-joining node, replicating the changes to all the nodes in the cluster

Primary Node - Every cluster has one Primary Node. On this node, we can run 'Isolated Processors'. ZooKeeper automatically selects a node to become Primary Node.

Isolated Processors - These processors run in isloated environment on the Primary Node. Eg :- GetSFTP Processor
